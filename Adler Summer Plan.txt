Introduction to Python
* Hello world!
* Variables
* Methods
* Operations with variables
* Variable types (integer vs float … 5 / 2 vs 5. / 2.)
* Reading / plotting data? (matplotlib)

Introduction to Astronomy
* Astronomical units
   * AU
   * Parsec
   * Degree, arc minute, arc second
   * RA, Dec
* Light
   * Light as a wave (and particle) 
      * Wavelength and frequency
         * Color (might be outside visible spectrum), energy level (Photoelectric effect)
   * Spectroscopy
* What’s a star?
   * Thermonuclear fusion
   * Stellar evolution
   * Black holes?
* What’s a galaxy?
   * Elliptical, spiral, irregular
   * Milky Way
      * 100 - 180,000 light years
      * 100 - 400 billion stars
      * Where we are, what our orbit’s like
   * Center of galaxies...AGN
   * IGM (1 atom / m^3)

Finding the Zone of Avoidance by plotting locations of observed galaxies


**Making a Hubble Diagram / Determining a Hubble Constant**

For this:
* Download a data set of all similar type galaxies (so that brightness ~= distance)
* Explain what redshift is
   * Siren, Doppler effect
   * Calculating redshift from spectrum of galaxies
   * Magnitude to flux to relative distance
* Convert redshift to recessional velocity units
* Plotting
* Finding slope / determining what it means (expansion rate of universe)
* From now on, can use redshift as a measure of distance

After: talk about the Hubble Constant

-every other galaxy is moving away? no reason we are special, so...
-universe is expanding
-what are units of H0? getting characteristic time -> 1/H0
-initial value -> Universe younger than Earth?
-current value
-cosmological constant
-how universe could end ... heat death, big crunch, critical density

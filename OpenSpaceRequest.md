This is a request for added functionality to the RenderableBillboardsClouds renderable. 

Firstly, we would like the ability to represent dynamically changing datasets through the addition of a time column that would allow 
datasets to be animated to appear as simulation time progresses. Here are a few examples of what this envisioned functionality could produce:
  * Animation of transient events (like Gamma Ray Bursts or supernovae) appearing on the sky as simulation time runs in OpenSpace
  * Representation of the increasing coverage of surveys like SDSS, i.e. galaxies appearing on the sky as they were observed in real-time 
  to visualize the survey "mapping" across the sky

Secondly, a related feature that would be great would be the ability to visualize simulations that trace particles' positions in a 
stepwise manner as time progresses, realized by providing particles' positions at different timesteps or a similar method.

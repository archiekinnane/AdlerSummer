# AdlerSummer

This is a repository for the Adler Planetarium's SVL Teen Program during Summer 2018. 

For an outline of the summer, see **Adler Summer Outline.md**.

**JupyterNotebooks** mainly houses notebooks created for the purpose of teaching Python, astronomy concepts, and data manipulation. Sometimes these notebooks work with datasets -- those can be found in **data**.

**Package** contains the code, tutorial, and examples for a package called *data2ops* created to automatically create the necessary files to visualize datasets in Open Space.

**os_files** is just an old version of the package described above and can be ignored.

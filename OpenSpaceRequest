This is a request for added functionality to the RenderableBillboardsClouds renderable. Broadly, we would like the ability to represent
dynamically changing datasets through the addition of a time column that would allow datasets to be animated as simulation time progresses. 

Here are a few examples of what the envisioned functionality could produce:
* Animation of Gamma Ray Bursts appearing on the sky as simulation time runs in OpenSpace
* Representation of the increasing coverage of surveys like SDSS, i.e. galaxies appearing on the sky as they were observed in real-time 
to visualize the survey "mapping" across the sky

Furthermore, the added dynamic capabilities would allow simulations to be run tracing particles' positions through different time steps.
